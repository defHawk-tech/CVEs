# Setting Up a Next.js App with NPM

Follow these steps to set up a Next.js application using NPM.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
- NPM (comes with Node.js)
- A terminal or command prompt

## Step 1: Clone or Download the Project

- If you have a project from a repository or a source:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

- Run the following command to install all dependencies based on `package-lock.json`:
    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

This ensures a clean install using the exact versions specified.

## Step 3: Verify Installation

- Check the Next.js version using:
    ```bash
    npm exec next -- --version
    ```
    Example Output:
    ```
    Next.js v15.2.2
    ```

## Step 4: Start the App

- Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

- Open your browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

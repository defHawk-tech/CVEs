## Steps to Set Up and Reproduce the Lab

1. **Download the Vulnerable Software**  
   [Download pfSense v2.5.2](https://github.com/CloudSentralDotNet/iso_pfsense). Make sure to select version 2.5.2.

2. **Set Up Your Virtual Lab**  
   Prepare two virtual machines: one as the attacker machine and another to host the pfSense software.

   *(Images can be added here for visual guidance)*

3. **Start pfSense and Log In**  
   - Launch pfSense and log in with the default credentials:  
     - **Username**: `admin`  
     - **Password**: `pfsense`  
   - Once logged in, obtain the IP address where pfSense is running for further configuration.  
   *(You can change the credentials as needed.)*

4. **Run the Proof of Concept (PoC) Script**  
   Use the PoC script to establish a connection and trigger the vulnerability.

5. **Confirm XSS Execution**  
   In this demonstration, `/etc/passwd` is used to show the impact of the XSS vulnerability, highlighting the potential consequences for testing purposes.
